The [Python Reference](https://stthomas.instructure.com/courses/86142/modules/items/4003532) has information that will be useful for this homework.\n",

    "\n",
    "The two building blocks of Python code are *expressions* and *statements*.  An **expression** is a piece of code that\n",
    "\n",
    "* is self-contained, meaning it would make sense to write it on a line by itself, and\n",
    "* usually evaluates to a value.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are two expressions that both evaluate to 3:\n",
    "\n",
    "    3\n",
    "    5 - 2\n",
    "    \n",
    "One important type of expression is the **call expression**. A call expression begins with the name of a function and is followed by the argument(s) of that function in parentheses. The function returns some value, based on its arguments. Some important mathematical functions are listed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Function | Description                                                   |\n",
    "|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------|\n",
    "| `abs`      | Returns the absolute value of its argument                    |\n",
    "| `max`      | Returns the maximum of all its arguments                      |\n",
    "| `min`      | Returns the minimum of all its arguments                      |\n",
    "| `pow`      | Raises its first argument to the power of its second argument |\n",
    "| `round`    | Rounds its argument to the nearest integer                     |\n",

    "    max(round(2.8), min(pow(2, 10), -1 * pow(2, 10)))\n",
    "\n",
    "The expression `2 - 5` and the two call expressions given above are examples of **compound expressions**, meaning that they are actually combinations of several smaller expressions.  `2 - 5` combines the expressions `2` and `5` by subtraction.  In this case, `2` and `5` are called **subexpressions** because they're expressions that are part of a larger expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **statement** is a whole line of code.  Some statements are just expressions.  The expressions listed above are examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other statements *make something happen* rather than *having a value*. For example, an **assignment statement** assigns a value to a name. \n",
    "\n",
    "A good way to think about this is that we're **evaluating the right-hand side** of the equals sign and **assigning it to the left-hand side**. Here are some assignment statements:\n",
    "    \n",
    "    height = 1.3\n",
    "    the_number_five = abs(-5)\n",
    "    absolute_height_difference = abs(height - 1.688)\n",
    "\n",
    "An important idea in programming is that large, interesting things can be built by combining many simple, uninteresting things.  The key to understanding a complicated piece of code is breaking it down into its simple components.\n",

    "Most programming involves work that is very similar to work that has been done before.  Since writing code is time-consuming, it's good to rely on others' published code when you can.  Rather than copy-pasting, Python allows us to **import modules**. A module is a file with Python code that has defined variables and functions. By importing a module, we are able to use its code in our own notebook.\n",

The second argument can be thought of as how many steps right or left you move from the decimal point. Negative numbers tell us to move left, and positive numbers tell us to move right. So, if we have `round(1234.5, -2)`, it means that we should move two places left, and then make all numbers to the right of this place zeroes. This would output the number 1200.0. On the other hand, if we have `round(6.789, 1)`, we should move one place right, and then make all numbers to the right of this place zeroes. This would output the number 6.8."
